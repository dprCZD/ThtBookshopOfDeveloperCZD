# ThtBookshopOfDeveloperCZD
It is a bookshop that users can buy some book about computer science on it.
And Admin can add or delete books,ban or release users on the system.
Mysql is the database.
It is based on SpringMVC framework.
Use Maven to build this project.


You can download this project and import it by Maven,then you can run it.


But there are some problems on this project.(such as the field cUser in the Usercontroller.)

I will solve these problems in the future and build it into jar.
